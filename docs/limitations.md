# Limitations

- The system uses regex-based extraction, which may miss
  highly obfuscated scam patterns.

- Honeypot responses are rule-based or LLM-assisted and
  may not always perfectly mimic human behavior.

- The demo uses a single-session honeypot and is not
  designed for large-scale concurrent deployment.

- Audio call analysis is outside the current scope and
  is proposed as future work.
